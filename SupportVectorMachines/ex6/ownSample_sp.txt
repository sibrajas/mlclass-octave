Now that final grades, statements of accomplishment, and verified certificates have been issued, we have one more request. We are interested in gathering feedback about this course and the Data Science Specialization in general so that we can make improvements and learn more about the overall course experience. 

Please take a few moments to help us out by completing our post-course survey. It should take no more than about 5 minutes.

Click here to launch the survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/L5SCDSL?user_id=a63be289179a155aa94d4131f9d64ca4439040f2

Finally, please note that access to the course site will end in five days. 

Thanks,

The Data Science Team
